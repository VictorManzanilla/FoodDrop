Fooddrop is an application to view and order from minority-owned restaurants in Chicago. 
Also, the explore option will lead you to a Google map to highlight some restaurants nearby. 
But, my free Google API subscription ended, so it doesn't work now. 
I wanted to create this app because many of these restaurants had been hit hard by covid-19. 
Also, it is a great way to show all these colorful and creative foods to other people. 
Lastly, it lets you explore the world from the comfort and safety of your own home.
